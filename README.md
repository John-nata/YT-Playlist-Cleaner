# YouTube Playlist Cleaner

## Overview

YouTube Playlist Cleaner is a userscript that helps you tidy up your YouTube playlists by automatically removing videos based on customisable settings. It now includes advanced features like batch processing, dark mode, and usage statistics for a better experience.

The development of this script was inspired by [@colejd's work](https://gist.github.com/astamicu/eb351ce10451f1a51b71a1287d36880f?permalink_comment_id=4489588#gistcomment-4489588).

This script has been further optimised with the help of Claude AI.
